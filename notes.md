# Spec breakdown
- There are 2 Emergency Departments (ED1, ED2)
- There are 2 Central Supply Rooms (CSR1, CSR2)
- There is 1 intersection they must cross (that I beleive is the "critical section")

- All MACs initilised moving towards intersection


understanding is that we don't need a queue to access the intersection as we are using a Fair Semaphore.

# TODO 
- updateTrailCount method needs improving to capture every crossing.
- need to find out if my MACs need to run in an order





# Build Notes
- I used Copilot to help me use BufferedReader for the first time.
